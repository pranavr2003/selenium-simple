On executing `run_it.py`, the user is prompted to enter a valid selenium-simple address. The code is then 
executed.

For example:

sel-simple/https://python.org/^assert "Python" in title^/?febn=q/c/k-pycon?K-RETURN/}

This address executes `tests.py. The `}` at the end indictes that the window must be closed upon execution

By default (specified in defaults.py), the window des not close upon execution of code.
